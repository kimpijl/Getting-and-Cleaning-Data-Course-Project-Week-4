# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-Week-4

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The source data set that this project was based on was obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, which describes how the data was initially collected as follows:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

This repository contains a run_analysis.R code, when run results in the data provided also in tidy_data.txt.
The written code will download a zipped data file, unzip it and loads the data into R. The code contains some comments that explain what is happening.
In short: the training and testing data is merged, only the measurements (columns) including mean, or standard deviation data are contained. To get more information from the column names, these have been adjusted to be (more) descriptive. Finally, for each individual in the dataset, for each activty, the mean of each distinct measurement is calculated. This output is stored in the tidy_data.txt file.
